## Process & Memory

### Memory layout of process

## Virtual memory
Secondary storage is simulated as main memory. When data in virtual memory is needed, it is swapped from virtual to physical memory.

Takes advantage of locality of reference which is the tendency for a processor to access memory locations within the same set
- Spatial locality: The next data retrieved by processor likely to be physical memory neighbor of previous data
- Temporal locality: Data retrieved likely to be reused.

## Memory Allocation
- brk(): sets end of data segment to value specified by `addr` only if value is within reason (i.e. enough memory & does not exceed limit)
- sbrk(): increments program data space by `increment` bytes
- malloc(): allocates memory according to given parameters by finding a suitable free block list, or, failing to do so, will increment heap size by using sbrk() system call. malloc() keeps consistency of free block list by keeping next & previous pointer
        ![malloc mechanism](caplure.png)
- free(): returns allocated memory to free block list

### Memory Leak
Process does not free up memory space after using resources

Prevented by using free() after malloc()

Check by using mtrace(), mtrace()
