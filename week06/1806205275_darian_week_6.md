# Week 6

## Make
Command to maintain groups of programs

Advantages:
- saves time typing and recompiling
- in distribution, easy to install

### Components
- Definition/Macros `name=value`
- Target Groups
```
        target : prerequisite(optional)
         <TAB> commands
```
- phony targets: avoids conflict with file of the same name

default target is the first listed target (common: `all`)

### Builtin macros
- $@ : Name of current target
- $? : the set of prerequisite that are younger than the target
- $< : the name of first prerequisite
- $* : the name of current prerequisite, without any suffix
