# Week 4

## Process
- Program: file containing range of info describimg how to construct process at run time
- Process: instance of executing program where system resources are allocated

Zombie process: process instructions have finished but parent process has not received exit status hence still listed in process table. Prevented by:
- using wait() on parent process
- ignoring child process signal with `signal(SIGCHILD, SIG_IGN)`
- using custom handlers

Orphaned process: parent process has finished running and terminated while child process is still active. Becomes adopted by init process

Daemon process: process running in the background achieved by intentionally orphaning the process

## PID & PPID
PID: identifier for process, can be retrieved from getpid()

PPID: ID for parent of process, retrieved from getppid(). Useful for kill() process in order to free up slots on the process table

## ps command

Fields in ps command:
- PID: process identifier
- USER: effective username

- NI: nice value
- VIRT: virtual memory
- RSS: resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used
- S: minimal state display
- %CPU: CPU utilization of the process
- %MEM: memory utilization of the process
- TIME+: total CPU usage time
- COMMAND: name of process including arguments if any
