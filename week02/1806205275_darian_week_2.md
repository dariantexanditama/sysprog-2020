## System Calls
1. Application runs the system call in code
2. Glibc wrapper for the system call is run
3. switching to kernel mode and triggers trap handler
4. the call runs on kernel level and then control returns to user

## Library Function
Pre-defined/inbuilt functions

Portable (only needs .h file which can be transferred easily) vs baked-in system call

Easier to debug because runs in user space, not kernel space
