# Week 7

## Shell Scripting

Writing programs that can be executed in a UNIX shell, e.g. bash, zsh, ksh.

Add `#!/bin/bash` to help identify program as bash script

## Operators

### Arithmetic Comparison
- < (-lt) : less than
- > (-gt) : greater than
- <= (-le) : less than or equal
- >= (-ge) : greater than or equal
- == (-eq) : equal
- != (-ne) : not equal

### String Comparison
- = : equal
- != : not equal
- < : less than
- > : greater than
- -n [str] : string str not empty
- -z [str] : string str empty

### File testing
- -b [file]	: Block special file
- -c [file]	: Special character file
- -d [dir] : Check for directory existence
- -e [file]	: Check for file existence
- -f [file]	: Check for regular file existence not a directory
- -G [file]	: Check if file exists and is owned by effective group ID.
- -g [file]	: true if file exists and is set-group-id.
- -k [file]	: Sticky bit
- -L [file]	: Symbolic link
- -O [file]	: True if file exists and is owned by the effective user id.
- -r [file]	: Check if file is a readable
- -S [file]	: Check if file is socket
- -s [file]	: Check if file is nonzero size
- -u [file]	: Check if file set-ser-id bit is set
- -w [file]	: Check if file is writable
- -x [file]	: Check if file is executable

### Redirection
- |
    (Pipes) Output of commands to the left of pipe becomes input for the right
- \>
    Output of commands to left is made into a file with file path specified to the right of operator
- \>>
    output of commands to left appends file of path specified to the right of operator
- <
    file path specified at the right of operator becomes input to commands on left of operator

## Variables
`VAR="val"`

Data type is either string or numeral

Shell script supports string formatting:
`echo "foo $BAR"`

Arguments passed as parameters to script are stored as follows:
- $0: full path of script
- $1: argument #1
- $2: argument #2
etc.

## Conditional branches
```
if [ condition1 ]; then
    code1
elif [ condition2 ]; then
    code2
else
    code3
fi
```

## Loops

### For
```
for item in list; do
    code
done
```

### While
```
while [ condition ]; do
    code
done
```

### Until
```
until [ condition ]; do
    code
done
```

## Functions
```
function foo {
    code
}
```
